# CandidateApplication

- Used symfony framework, since the console helpers are a great help for making command line applications.
- The autowiring in the service container, makes adding and extending classes easy.
- Did not include the whole framework and used a custom microkernel to keep things clean.
- Added a logger using Monolog, so we can add debug messages. 
In the future it is easy to add an extra handler to push message to a logging system (Syslog, Elasticsearch).
